#1. Write a Python program to,
#(a) Add 20 and 15, and print the result.
print(20+15)
#(b) Subtract 12 from 50, and print the result.
print(12-50)
#(c) Multiply 8 and 7, and print the result.
print(8*7)
#(d) Divide 100 by 25, and print the result.
print(100/25)
#(e) Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 5, and print the result.
print(17%5)

#2. Write a Python program that,
#(a) Compares two numbers (x = 15, y = 10) and prints whether x is greater thany.
x=15
y=10
print(x>y)
#(b) Checks if 25 is equal to 25 and prints the result.
print(25==25)
#(c) Checks if 30 is not equal to 25 and prints the result.
print(30!=25)
#(d) Compares 10 and 20 using <= and prints the result.
print(10<=20)

#3. Write a Python program to
#(a) Check if both 5 > 3 and 10 > 5 are true, and print the result
print((5>3)and(10>5))
#(b) Check if 7 > 9 or 15 > 10 is true, and print the result.
print((7>9)or(15>10))
#(c) Use not to check if 8 == 8 and print the result.
print(not(8==8))

#4. Define variables for the following data types and print them,
#(a) An integer x = 100.
x = 100
print(x)
#(b) A float y = 45.67
y = 45.67
print(y)
#(c) A string name = ”Alice”.
name = "Alice"
print(name)
